- **Sprites and Costumes**: Add and customize sprites with various costumes.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag and drop actions onto the canvas to build your project.
- **Events and Control**: Utilize events and control blocks to make your projects interactive.

## Design and Demonstration

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
